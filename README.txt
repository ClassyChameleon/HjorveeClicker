README.txt FOR HJÖRVEE CLICKER.

You will need the Unity engine installed to play this.

Be aware that this project is very crude and
was mostly based on inside humor from immature tweens.
Despite this, the Hjörvee Clicker project was made with lots of love.

-----------------------------------------
1. START
--------
Make sure all the files are in the same folder (or directory) before starting.
Upon starting you'll be prompted to adjust Screen resolution and other options.
Recommended settings:
	Windowed [x]
	1024 x 768
	Fantastic
	Display 1

There is no need to check the Input tab since the only input for this game
is from the mouse.

-----------------------------------------
2. PLAYING
----------
Once the game is started you'll be subjected to what may be called music.
Unfortunately there's no built-in mute button or a music controller.
You'll have to turn down your volume, but be sure to turn it back on once you win.

On the screen you'll see a blueish background, a purchase menu, score counter,
a dinosaur background and a moving Hjörvee.
You get points by clicking on Hjörvee.
If you click on him while he's spinning, you get negative points.
If you click on him while the dinosaur is spinning, you get 5x points.
If you click while both are spinning, you get negative 5x points.
The more points you get, the faster Hjörvee goes.
You can slow Hjörvee down by buying him medication once you get enough points.

This game is designed to go faster and faster as you go. Every milestone quicker
to reach than the last.
the fastest strategy is buying PowerClicks until the time it takes to buy PowerClicks
isn't worth it anymore.
The more expensive purchases are better than the cheaper one for their cost.
Autoclickers are recommended (especially during the grueling early game)

-----------------------------------------
3. WIN
------
After clicking the win button an animation will play out and a darker hjörvee
will appear alongside a The End button with ominous ambience sounds.
You can click on The End button to get to the end screen. (refer to THE END SCREEN)
You can also keep clicking on Hjörvee to play a second phase of the game.

-----------------------------------------
4. SECOND PHASE
---------------
This is a very sinister and dark phase of the game.
If you speed up the music by 666% you'll get the Yee music.
The game gives you very little information about what is happening in this phase.
Hjörvee doesn't move at all and has a red tint on it's face.
The background dinosaur is nowhere to be seen and the bluish screen is now black.
The point counter doesn't state that it's your score, it just says the number.
Periodically other buttons such as Steal, Murder and Exploit will pop up and
you can click them for additional points. A Kidnap button may appear that allows you
to gain a slave that gains points for you.

Throughout this process the The End button will tell you to stop. I don't remember
whether it still allows you to prompt the end screen if you click on it at this point.
After reaching 420 points the The End button will disappear.
You finish this phase at 1000.

-----------------------------------------
5. THE END SCREEN
-----------------
Whether you play the second phase or not, you'll get the same end screen.
The dinosaur will appear in full color and the text "You either die
a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain".
Shortly after the dinosaur will lose its color and become black and white.
Then the text disappears and "Thanks for playing." appears.
After this it is safe to close the program as nothing more will happen.

-----------------------------------------
6. I WANTED TO ADD A THIRD PHASE
--------------------------------
I wanted to create a third phase that contrasts the second phase.
I envisioned Hjörvee in hell gaining wings and attempting to fly up. The player needed
to click on Hjörvee to help him fly up. After flying steadily for a while a button will
appear. You click on it and suddenly Hjörvee flies up in hyperspeed like a rocket. Now
instead of clicking on him you click on the obstacles trying to attack him from the
sides.

First you're in hell and demons attack Hjörvee. Then you break through the
Earths crust and fly through Earths atmosphere. There you must click on military
rockets to protect Hjörvee. Then you get to space and you must click on asteroids.
Each of these phases are more difficult than the last.

The demons would be slow enough and designed so that the player would click on them
and realize the new game plan. The rockets would be faster but still manageable and
then the asteroids will be difficult but still very possible. Here I would decide
whether the player has 2 or 1 life where 2 lives would mean that if an obstacle hits
Hjörvee he loses a wing but can still fly. 1 life means that he loses both wings with
1 hit. Losing your wings mean you get a bad ending or try again (you choose).
Succeeding means you get the true ending.

The visuals and music I wanted for this phase were out of my reach. The backgrounds
were manageable but I wanted a speed effect on Hjörvee during his flight and the music
was unthinkable. I couldn't think of any music that existed that I would want in this
part and I didn't know anyone who could make that music. Even if I did I wouldn't know
how to explain what I wanted.

7. FINAL THOUGHTS
-----------------
I had fun making this project. I planned many different far more ambitious games such
as a boss rush game with a database about stats and times but the way I wanted to do it
was not a one man job. Then I decided to just make another Hjörvee Clicker. Instead of
working evenly on this project I crunched on the last month and finished the first stage
earlier than expected. I was fiddling with how I should have my end screen. I thought
about having Hjörvee red or damaged after the explosion and it reminded me of Undertale.
It reminded me of the genocide run in Undertale with the creepy music and ominous
messages. So I decided I want to do something like that. It just all fit together and
felt like such a natural progression. I don't think anyone knows about this ending.

Most of my game have more artistic value than good gameplay.
Previously I made Hjörvee Shooter where you are a spaceship and in front
of you is Hjörvee. You can shoot at him and get 10 points each time but every time you
do Hjörvee loses health and becomes darker. Asteroids spawn on his sides and if they hit
him they do damage to him like your shots. The asteroids are a bit delayed in their
initial spawning so the player will think "Oh I just gotta shoot Hjörvee" but once
the asteroids spawn and damage Hjörvee they think "Oh no! I'm supposed to protect
Hjörvee!" and all the while you have "Over the Rainbow" playing. It's short, simple
and really toys with you as a player.
